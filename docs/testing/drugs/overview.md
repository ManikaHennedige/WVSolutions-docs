## Drug Tests

### Overview

The automated computation of drug doses should be robust, with zero tolerance for error. As such, every single existing use case for each drug should be tested.
We have separated test cases by the species and animal weights, and the list of drugs (and their respective concentrations) are listed below. Drug dosages are determined by a veterinary professional, and based on existing recognized literature.

### Methodology

In this case, we have taken sample weights of animals of different species (mostly cats and dogs), and test them at specified weights based on identified equivalence classes
